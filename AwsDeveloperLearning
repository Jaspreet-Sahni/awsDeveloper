----------IAM Start Here---------------------
IAM
1) IAM(Identity and Access Management) Introduction
 a) Your Whole AWS Security is there:
  .) User
  .) Groups
  .) Roles
b) Root Account should never be used(and shared)
c) Users must be created with proper permission
d) IAM is at the center of AWS( i.e Global)
e) IAM has Policies which are written in JSON

** Root account is the account which has all rights of AWS and which create User Profile in AWS 
and provide access to other USER of AWS to access its AWS Services.

Users--> Usually a physical person
Groups --> Functions( admins, devops) & Teams (enginnering , design)
Roles----> Internal Usage with AWS resources

Policies(JSON Document) -- It define what each of the three(USERS, GROUPS, Roles) can and cannot do

f) IAM has a Global View
g) Permission are governed by Polocies(JSON)
h) MFA(Multi Factor Authenticaon) can be setup
i) IAM has prdefined 'managed Plocies'

-----------EC2 Starts here------------
2) EC2
a) EC2 is the most popular AWS offering
b) It mainly consist of the capability of
   .) Renting Virtual Machine (EC2)
   .)Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
   .) Distributing load across machines (ELB)
   .) Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

c) AMI (AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE)

-----------EC2 ENDS here------------

-----------SSH Starts here------------


SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH is one of the most important function, It allows you to control a remote machine, all using the command Line.

SSH on MAC---->
How to access the EC2Machine through CMD
1) Open CMd
2) ssh ec2-user@35.180.100.144           // syntax ssh (ec2LinuxMachineUser@public ip)
3) In a folder save your key file (eg: EC2Tutorial.pem) 
  a) Open CMD from the saved folder
  Actions to be done in CMD
   b) ls    // Output EC2Tutorial.pem
   c) ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@35.180.100.144    (in CMD)
   d) you will get a warning ( VIMP   Warning code 0644(UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY) for EC2Tutorial.pem)
   e) chmod 0400 EC2Tutorial.pem   (in CMD)
   f) ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@35.180.100.144    (in CMD)
  h) now you can sucess fully connected it
  i) ping google.com
  j) CTRL + D  to disconnect
  
  
  SSH on Windows Machine-->
  We will configure all  the required parameters necesaary for doing  SSH on Windows using PUTTY
 1) Download the Putty 64 bit
 2) Open the Windows and search PuttyGen to convert the already downloaded keygen(Private File) 
     file (EC2Tutorial.pem to EC2Tutorial.ppk)
 3) Load the File (EC2Tutorial.pem) after openeing PUTTY Key Gen and Press SAVE PRIVATE KEY Button, name the file (EC2Tutorial.ppk)
 4) Press YES
 
 Now Open Windows and open Putty and open Putty Program
 
 1) Now Paste the IP address of EC2Machine on HostName of Putty along with it like this: ec2-user@35.180.100.140
 2) Now Add 'MySession' and Save Session with eg:MySession
 3) Now close the Putty and open again and ho to connection-->SSH -> auth --> upload the PPK file just generated-->
       -->Go Back to Session Save the session (MySession)---> Now Click the OPEn where you oploaded you SSH File
 4) Now your session gets created and EC2 Machine connected
 5) Test connection by writting whoamI or ping google.com
