----------IAM Start Here---------------------
IAM
1) IAM(Identity and Access Management) Introduction
 a) Your Whole AWS Security is there:
  .) User
  .) Groups
  .) Roles
b) Root Account should never be used(and shared)
c) Users must be created with proper permission
d) IAM is at the center of AWS( i.e Global)
e) IAM has Policies which are written in JSON

** Root account is the account which has all rights of AWS and which create User Profile in AWS 
and provide access to other USER of AWS to access its AWS Services.

Users--> Usually a physical person
Groups --> Functions( admins, devops) & Teams (enginnering , design)
Roles----> Internal Usage with AWS resources

Policies(JSON Document) -- It define what each of the three(USERS, GROUPS, Roles) can and cannot do

f) IAM has a Global View
g) Permission are governed by Polocies(JSON)
h) MFA(Multi Factor Authenticaon) can be setup
i) IAM has prdefined 'managed Plocies'

----------IAM Ends Here---------------------

-----------EC2 Starts here------------
2) EC2
Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (AMAZON EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon Ec2 reduces the
time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allow you to quicky scale capacity both UP and Down.

a) EC2 is the most popular AWS offering
b) It mainly consist of the capability of
   .) Renting Virtual Machine (EC2)
   .)Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
   .) Distributing load across machines (ELB)
   .) Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

c) AMI (AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE)

--EC2 options-
 *) On Demand -- allow you to pay fixed rate per hour( or by seconds) with no commitment
 *) Reserved -- provides you with capacity reservation and offer significant discount o hourly charge. It has 1 to Years Term
 *) Spot  -- enables you to bid for whatever price for instance capacity. Good if your application has flexible start and End time
 *) Dedicated Hosts -- Physical EC2 servers dedicated for your use wher its your server only and no other company sharing that server.

 --Reserved Instance
  a) Schedule Reserved Instance, Nw you can schedule a reserved instance like on any day , month ets eg: schedule a reserved instance on every
   last friday of a month and pay only for that period

-----------EC2 ENDS here------------


------------ EBS Starts Here ------------
EBS (ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE) -- Amazon EBS allow you to create storage and attach them to EC2 instances. 
Once attached we can create a file system on top of these volumes. Once attached we can create a file system on top of these volume,
run databaseor use them in any other way you would use a block device.
Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific availiabilty zone and can be replicated automatically to protect you from the failure of
single component.


-EBS Volume Type 

SSD Volume Types
a) GENERAL PURPOSE SSD (GP2)--
  a.1) General purpose balances between both price and performance
  a.2) Ratio of 3 IOPS(input/Output operations per second) per GB with upto 10,000 IOPS and abillity to burst upto 3,000 IOPS for
      a extended period of time for volumes at 3334GiB and above
      
b) Provisioned IOPS SSD (101)
  b.1) designed for I/O Intensive application such as large Relational or NoSQL databases.
  b.2) Used if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
  b.3) Can provision upto 20,000 IOPS per volume

Magnitic Volume Type
c) Throughput Optimised SSD (ST1)
  Throughput optimised SSD used for
  c.1) Big Data
  c.2) Data WareHouse
  c.3) Log processing
  c.4) cannot be a boot Volume(A boot volume refers to that portion of the hard drive that contains the operating system)
  
d) Cold HDD (SC1)
 d.1) Lowest Cost Storage for infrequently accessed workload
 d.2) File Server
 d.3)  cannot be a boot Volume(A boot volume refers to that portion of the hard drive that contains the operating system)
 
e) Magnetic (standard)
 e.1) Lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume type that are bootable. Magnetic volume are ideals for workloads where data is 
     accessed infrequently

-----------SSH Starts here------------

SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH is one of the most important function, It allows you to control a remote machine, all using the command Line.

SSH on MAC---->
How to access the EC2Machine through CMD
1) Open CMd
2) ssh ec2-user@35.180.100.144           // syntax ssh (ec2LinuxMachineUser@public ip)
3) In a folder save your key file (eg: EC2Tutorial.pem) 
  a) Open CMD from the saved folder
  Actions to be done in CMD
   b) ls    // Output EC2Tutorial.pem
   c) ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@35.180.100.144    (in CMD)
   d) you will get a warning ( VIMP   Warning code 0644(UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY) for EC2Tutorial.pem)
   e) chmod 0400 EC2Tutorial.pem   (in CMD)
   f) ssh -i EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@35.180.100.144    (in CMD)
  h) now you can sucess fully connected it
  i) ping google.com
  j) CTRL + D  to disconnect
  
  
  SSH on Windows Machine-->
  We will configure all  the required parameters necesaary for doing  SSH on Windows using PUTTY
 1) Download the Putty 64 bit
 2) Open the Windows and search PuttyGen to convert the already downloaded keygen(Private File) 
     file (EC2Tutorial.pem to EC2Tutorial.ppk)
 3) Load the File (EC2Tutorial.pem) after openeing PUTTY Key Gen and Press SAVE PRIVATE KEY Button, name the file (EC2Tutorial.ppk)
 4) Press YES
 
 Now Open Windows and open Putty and open Putty Program
 
 1) Now Paste the IP address of EC2Machine on HostName of Putty along with it like this: ec2-user@35.180.100.140
 2) Now Add 'MySession' and Save Session with eg:MySession
 3) Now close the Putty and open again and ho to connection-->SSH -> auth --> upload the PPK file just generated-->
       -->Go Back to Session Save the session (MySession)---> Now Click the OPEn where you oploaded you SSH File
 4) Now your session gets created and EC2 Machine connected
 5) Test connection by writting whoamI or ping google.com

Now Open SSH on Windows10 Machine Only

1) open CMD
2) ssh
3) ssh -i C:\?Users\Stephan\Downloads\EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@35.180.242.162
4) in cmd write yes  (to trust the windows ip)
5) if you get some warning
  a) Then Right Ckick on the EC2Tutorial.pem and go to properties
  b) propserties --> security --> advanced--> permission ---> Change(Write your Name Jaspreet) ---> disable  Inhertance 
  c) Only you should be able to see that file and give full access to it
  
5) ssh -i C:\?Users\Stephan\Downloads\EC2Tutorial.pem ec2-user@35.180.242.162

--------SSH Ends Here -------------
------------Security Group Starts Here-----------
1) Security Group are the fundamentals of Network Security in AWS
2) They control how the traffic is allowed IN or OUT of your EC2 Machine
3) It helps in trouble Shooting Network Issues
4) Security Groups are acting as a "firewall' on EC2 instances
5) They Regulate
  *) Access to ports
  *) Authorised IP ranges -- IP4 and IP6
  *) Control of Inbound Network( from other to EC2 Instance-machine)
  *) Control of Outbound Network( from EC2 Instance-machine to Others)

------------Security Group ENDS Here-----------

------------Public ,Private, Elastic IP Starts Here-----------
1) Public IP
 a) Public Ip means machine can be identified on the internet (WWW)
 b) Must be unique across the Whole Web (not two machine can have the same IP)

2) Private IP
 a) Private IP means the machine can only be identified on a private network only
 b) The IP must be unique across the private network
 c) But tow different private networks (two companies) can have the same IP
 d) Machine connect to WWW using an internet gateway (a proxy)
 e) Only a specified range of IP's can be used as private IP.
 
3) ELastic IP (Simpaly means Fixed Public IP which not change)

a) If you need to have a fixed public IP, for your instance you need a Elastic IP
b) When you Stop and then Start an EC2 Instance, it can change its public IP
c) An Elastic IP is a public IPv4 IP you own as long as you don't delete it
d) You can attach it to one instance at a time
e) With Elastic IP address,  you can quicky mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another
   instance in your account
f) You can only have 5 Elastic Ip in your account (you can ask AWS to increase that)
g) Overall try to Avoid using Elastic IP.

------------Public ,Private, Elastic IP ENDS Here-----------

-----ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER Start Here-------

Elastic load balancer, it helps to balance our load across multiple services

Types of Load Balancer
1) Application Load Balancer( It operates at OSI7 Layer)
2) Network Load Balancer (It Operates at Layer4 and the most expensive load balancer)
3) Classic Load Balancer


-----ELASTIC LOAD BALANCER ENDS Here-------
